# Integrating Meteorological Data with Air Quality Data from the GIOŚ Database 🌤️💨

## Project Overview 📄
This project focuses on the integration of meteorological data with air quality data sourced from the GIOŚ (Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection) database. The analysis is based on data from the monitoring station located in **Częstochowa**, spanning the years **2000-2020**. The primary objective is to forecast air pollution levels for a selected year and identify the correlations between meteorological variables and air quality indicators.

## Key Objectives 🎯
- **Data Integration**: Merging meteorological and air quality datasets.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the relationships between weather conditions and air pollution levels.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting air quality using machine learning models, with a focus on **Random Forest**.
- **Technical Reporting**: Documenting the process and results using **RMarkdown** for reproducibility and clarity.

## Data Sources 📊
The project utilizes two key data sources:
- **Meteorological Data**: Variables include temperature, humidity, wind speed, among others.
- **Air Quality Data (GIOŚ)**: Concentration levels of pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, and NO2.

These datasets cover the monitoring station in **Częstochowa** and provide a comprehensive view of the air quality trends over a 20-year period.

## Methodology 🧠
The project is carried out using the **R** programming language for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. Key methodologies include:
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Used for predictive modeling of air pollution levels.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Applied to assess the relationships between meteorological conditions and air quality metrics.
- **RMarkdown**: Employed to generate technical reports that encapsulate the analysis and findings in a well-documented format.

## Results and Insights 📈
The project's output includes:
- **Air Pollution Forecast**: Predicted levels of pollutants for the selected year based on historical data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Visual and statistical insights into the relationships between meteorological factors and air quality.
- **Visualizations**: A range of charts and plots illustrating air quality trends and model performance.

## Technical Contributions 🧑‍💻
This project demonstrates expertise in:
- **Data Integration**: Merging multi-source datasets (meteorological and air quality).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Application of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, for environmental data forecasting.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Assessing the impact of various weather variables on air pollution levels.
- **Reproducible Research**: Full documentation and reporting using RMarkdown, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the results.
